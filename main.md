To investigate whether stable working groups affect the outcomes and severity of punishments in Russian courts, I conducted an empirical analysis using court decision data from 2017. The analysis involved data extraction, preprocessing, and applying machine learning models to evaluate the influence of these stable working groups.

**1. Data Collection**

I utilize the 'text' column to extract information about the judges, prosecutors, and defense attorneys involved in each case, along with the case outcomes and the severity of punishments.

The key variables in our study include:

**Independent Variable:**
  - Stable Working Groups: Identifies instances where the same judge, prosecutor, and defense attorney work together on a case.

**Dependent Variables:**
  - Judicial Outcomes: A binary variable indicating whether the defendant was found guilty or not guilty. We'll analyze if stable working groups influence the likelihood of a conviction.
  - Punishment Severity: Quantifies the severity of punishments, including prison sentence lengths, fines, or other penalties. We'll standardize these penalties by converting sentences into years or fines into monetary values adjusted for inflation.


**2. Data Preprocessing**


For data preprocessing, I extract the names of judges, prosecutors, and defense attorneys from the text data using regular expressions (regex). This involves parsing court decision texts to accurately identify the legal professionals involved in each case, paying particular attention to the grammatical structure and variations in legal terminology in Russian. Regex is a powerful tool for pattern matching in text. By defining specific patterns, I can search for and extract relevant information from court decision texts. This approach ensures accurate extraction of names of judges, prosecutors, and defense attorneys even when they appear in different grammatical forms.

### Regex Patterns:

- **Judges**: Patterns like `судья\s+([\w\s]+(?:в|а|е|ой|ью)?)` matched the title "судья" followed by a name with possible case endings (e.g., Иванов А.А.).
- **Prosecutors**: Patterns like `прокурор\s+([\w\s]+(?:а|у|ом|е)?)` matched the title "прокурор" followed by a name with case endings.
- **Defense Attorneys**: Patterns like `адвокат\s+([\w\s]+(?:а|у|ом|е)?)` matched the title "адвокат" followed by a name with case endings.

Similarly, extracting punishment severity involves identifying and quantifying details related to the sentences imposed, such as the length of prison terms, types of penal colonies, fines, and other penalties. These details are then converted into a standardized severity metric, such as total years of punishment.

### Regex Patterns for Punishment Severity:

- **Years of Imprisonment**: The pattern `(\d+)\s*лет` matches sentences expressed in years. Directly added to the severity score as the number of years.
- **Months of Imprisonment**: The pattern `(\d+)\s*месяцев` matches sentences expressed in months and converts them to years. Converted to a fraction of a year and then added to the severity score.
- **Types of Penal Colonies**: The pattern `(общего режима|строгого режима|особого режима)` matches different types of penal colonies and assigns corresponding severity values:
  - General Regime penal colonies are considered less severe compared to strict or special regime colonies. The value of 2 is chosen to reflect this lesser severity while still recognizing that it involves imprisonment.
  - Strict Regime penal colonies are more severe than general regime colonies, involving stricter conditions and more restrictive environments. The value of 5 is chosen to represent this increased severity.
  - Special Regime penal colonies are the most severe, reserved for the most dangerous offenders or those with severe sentences. The value of 10 is chosen to reflect the highest level of severity.
- **Fines**: The pattern `штраф\s*в\s*размере\s*(\d+)` matches monetary fines and normalizes them by a factor. Fines are normalized by a factor to reflect their severity relative to other punishment types. For instance, a fine is divided by 10,000 to scale it appropriately.
- **Probation**: The pattern `условно\s*на\s*(\d+)\s*лет` matches probation sentences and subtracts them from the severity score.
- **Pre-trial Detention**: The pattern `временное\s*содержание\s*под\s*стражей\s*(\d+)\s*дней` matches pre-trial detention periods and converts them to years.
